## Prerequisites for Using Create Web3 Template CLI

To ensure a smooth setup and use of **`Create Web3 Template`** CLI, please make sure to meet the following prerequisites:

### 1. Node.js

- **Version Requirement**: Node.js version 14 or later is required. **`Create Web3 Template`** uses features that are only available in Node.js v14 and newer versions.
- **Installation**: If Node.js is not already installed on your system, or if you're using an earlier version, you can download the latest version from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). Choose the version appropriate for your operating system and follow the installation instructions provided on the site.

### 2. npm (Node Package Manager)

- **Overview**: npm is the default package manager for Node.js and comes bundled with Node.js installations. It is used to install **`Create Web3 Template`**, manage its versions, and handle its dependencies.
- **Version Checking and Updating**: To check your current npm version, run **`npm -v`** in your terminal. If you need to update npm, you can do so by running **`npm install -g npm`** in your terminal. This command updates npm to the latest version.

### 3. Web3 Wallet (Optional)

- **Purpose**: While not required for the installation of **`Create Web3 Template`**, having a web3 wallet like MetaMask can enhance your development experience. It allows you to interact with Ethereum networks, test dApps, and perform transactions during development.
- **Recommendation**: If your project or learning path involves direct interaction with blockchain networks or smart contracts, consider installing a web3 wallet in your browser. MetaMask is a popular choice and can be found at [MetaMask's official website](https://metamask.io/).
